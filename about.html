    <!-- My Story -->
    <section class="card" id="story">
      <h2>My Story</h2>

      <p>
        I am currently completing my senior year at Georgia State University, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer
        Science.
        My interest in programming comes from wanting to build things that actually work in real situations, not just for
        assignments.
        I actively look for opportunities to apply what I learn through personal projects and hands-on practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        I value clean structure and good habits when it comes to coding. One lesson I’ve learned over time is that it’s better
        to build something simple, test it, and improve it step by step rather than waiting for everything to be perfect from
        the start.
        This approach has helped me stay consistent and make steady progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of academics, I enjoy fitness and maintaining a structured routine. Staying consistent in my daily habits
        has made a big difference in how I manage coursework, projects, and long-term goals. I’ve found that discipline
        outside
        of coding translates directly into better focus and productivity when working on technical problems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now, my main focus is strengthening my fundamentals, including HTML, CSS, programming structure, and writing
        readable, maintainable code. I’m especially interested in developing skills that scale well over time and prepare me
        for real-world software development environments.
